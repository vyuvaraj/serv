# ServRegistry Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development phases for the ServRegistry package manager hub.

---

## Differentiating Factors (Why ServRegistry?)

* **Integrated with Serv-lang**: Native compiler-level integration using `serv.toml` to install and resolve modules (`serv install`) without third-party tools.
* **Shared Storage Backend**: Avoids managing separate storage platforms by directly mounting package layers to `ServStore` S3 buckets.
* **On-the-Fly Dependency Resolution**: Native dependency resolution endpoint using BFS to automatically retrieve, traverse, and output complete dependency trees.
* **OTel Integration**: Standardised OTel traces track publishing latency, size metrics, and cache-hit ratios directly to `ServTrace` and `ServConsole`.

## Phase 1: Core Registry & Auth (Completed)
- [x] **Package Upload & Retrieval**: HTTP APIs for publishing and fetching tarball payloads.
- [x] **Manifest Parsing**: Automated `serv.toml` parsing within archives to capture names, versions, and dependencies.
- [x] **Embedded Dashboard**: Premium, glassmorphic client interface to view and search package indexes.
- [x] **JWT Security**: Verification of signature tokens to protect publishing scopes.

## Phase 2: Semver Range Resolution (Q3 2026)
- [x] **Range Matching**: Add server-side parsing for semantic version ranges (e.g. `^1.2.0`, `~0.4.1`).
- [x] **Package Deprecation**: API flag to mark versions as deprecated with warning payloads.

## Phase 3: Cryptographic Signatures (Q4 2026)
- [x] **Package Signing**: Support uploading `.sig` signature files alongside tarballs.
- [x] **Public Key Verification**: Cryptographically verify author signatures at the command-line before installation.

## Phase 4: Architectural Depth & DevOps (Pending)
- [ ] **`serv registry audit`** — CLI command that scans installed packages for known vulnerable versions, outdated dependencies, and deprecated packages, with fix suggestions (Security / DX)
- [ ] **Private Namespace Support** — Scoped package namespaces (`@org/package`) with access control lists; teams can publish internal packages without exposing to the public index (DevOps)
- [ ] **Mirror & Offline Cache** — Local proxy mode that caches the public registry to a ServStore bucket; enables air-gapped builds and faster CI pipelines with zero external fetches (DevOps)
- [ ] **Provenance Attestation** — Record build provenance (commit SHA, CI run ID, builder identity) alongside the package; verify with `serv verify --attestation` for supply-chain security (Security)

## Phase 5: Package Extraction & Scale (Pending — July 2026)

> **Issue:** `main.go` is 1,007 lines. Monolithic structure prevents independent testing and extension.

| # | Item | Effort | Description | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 5.1 | **Extract `pkg/registry/`** | Medium | Move package storage, versioning, and metadata management into dedicated package | [ ] |
| 5.2 | **Extract `pkg/resolution/`** | Medium | Move dependency resolution, semver matching, and BFS tree traversal into dedicated package | [ ] |
| 5.3 | **Extract `pkg/web/`** | Small | Move embedded dashboard handlers and asset serving into dedicated package | [ ] |
| 5.4 | **Package download stats** | Small | Track download counts per package/version. Surface in dashboard and `serv packages --stats` | [ ] |
| 5.5 | **Webhook notifications** | Small | Notify on new package publish via configurable webhooks. Useful for CI triggers | [ ] |
| 5.6 | **Package license scanning** | Medium | Detect and surface package license metadata. Warn on incompatible licenses during `serv install` | [ ] |

## Phase 6: Code Health & Test Coverage (Pending — Phase 22)

> **Issue:** main.go is 1,363 lines. Test coverage: 11 functions in 2 files.

| # | Item | Effort | Description | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 6.1 | **Decompose main.go** | Medium | Target <100 lines. Extract: pkg/registry/ (storage), pkg/resolution/ (semver), pkg/web/ (dashboard), pkg/signing/ (crypto) | [ ] |
| 6.2 | **Expand test coverage** | Medium | From 11 → 35+ test functions: semver range resolution, signature verification, dependency tree cycles | [ ] |
